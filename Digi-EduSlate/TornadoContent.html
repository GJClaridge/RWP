        	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
        	  <p>Tornadoes are nature’s most violent storms. Spawned from powerful thunderstorms, tornadoes can cause fatalities and devastate a neighborhood in seconds. A tornado appears as a rotating, funnel-shaped cloud that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground with whirling winds that can reach 300 miles per hour. Damage paths can be in excess of one mile wide and 50 miles long.</p>
              <h2>Before a Tornado</h2>
        	  <div class="accordion_fold" style="display: block;"><ul><li>Be alert to changing weather conditions. Look for approaching storms.</li><li>Look for the following danger signs:<ul><li>Dark, often greenish sky</li><li>Large hail</li><li>A large, dark, low-lying cloud (particularly if rotating)</li><li>Loud roar, similar to a freight train.</li><li>If you see approaching storms or any of the danger signs, be prepared to take shelter immediately.</li></ul></li></ul><div><h3>Tornado Facts</h3><p>Quick facts you should know&nbsp;about tornadoes:</p><ul><li>They may strike quickly, with little or no warning.</li><li>They may appear nearly transparent until dust and debris are picked up or a cloud forms in the funnel.</li><li>The average tornado moves Southwest to Northeast, but tornadoes have been known to move in any direction.</li><li>The average forward speed of a tornado is 30 mph, but may vary from stationary to 70 mph.</li><li>Tornadoes can accompany tropical storms and hurricanes as they move onto land.</li><li>Waterspouts are tornadoes that form over water.</li><li>Tornadoes are most frequently reported east of the Rocky Mountains during spring and summer months.</li><li>Tornadoes are most likely to occur between 3 pm and 9 pm, but can occur at any time.</li></ul></div></div>
              <h2>During a Tornado</h2>
        	  <div class="accordion_fold" style="display: block;"><p>If you are not in a sturdy building, there is no single research-based recommendation for what last-resort action to take because many factors can affect your decision. Possible actions include:</p><ul><li>Immediately get into a vehicle, buckle your seat belt and try to drive to the closest sturdy shelter. If your vehicle is hit by flying debris while you are driving, pull over and park.</li><li>Take cover in a stationary vehicle. Put the seat belt on and cover your head with your arms and a blanket, coat or other cushion if possible.</li><li>Lie in an area noticeably lower than the level of the roadway and cover your head with your arms and a blanket, coat or other cushion if possible.</li></ul><p>In all situations:</p><ul><li>Do not get under an overpass or bridge. You are safer in a low, flat location.</li><li>Never try to outrun a tornado in urban or congested areas in a car or truck. Instead, leave the vehicle immediately for safe shelter.</li><li>Watch out for flying debris. Flying debris from tornadoes causes most fatalities and injuries.</li></ul></td>
