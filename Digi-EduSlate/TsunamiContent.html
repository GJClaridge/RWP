        	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
        	  <p>Tsunamis, also known as seismic sea waves, are a series of enormous waves created by an underwater disturbance such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite. A tsunami can move hundreds of miles per hour in the open ocean and smash into land with waves as high as 100 feet or more.</p>
			  <p>From the area where the tsunami originates, waves travel outward in all directions. Once the wave approaches the shore, it builds in height. The topography of the coastline and the ocean floor will influence the size of the wave. There may be more than one wave and the succeeding one may be larger than the one before. That is why a small tsunami at one beach can be a giant wave a few miles away.</p>
			  <p>All tsunamis are potentially dangerous, even though they may not damage every coastline they strike. A tsunami can strike anywhere along most of the U.S. coastline. The most destructive tsunamis have occurred along the coasts of California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii.</p>
			  <p>Earthquake-induced movement of the ocean floor most often generates tsunamis. If a major earthquake or landslide occurs close to shore, the first wave in a series could reach the beach in a few minutes, even before a warning is issued. Areas are at greater risk if they are less than 25 feet above sea level and within a mile of the shoreline. Drowning is the most common cause of death associated with a tsunami. Tsunami waves and the receding water are very destructive to structures in the run-up zone. Other hazards include flooding, contamination of drinking water, and fires from gas lines or ruptured tanks.</p>
              <h2>Before a Tsunami</h2>
        	  <p><ul>
        	    <li>To begin preparing, you should build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.<ul><li>Talk to everyone in your household about what to do if a tsunami occurs. Create and practice an evacuation plan for your family. Familiarity may save your life. Be able to follow your escape route at night and during inclement weather. You should be able to reach your safe location on foot within 15 minutes. Practicing your plan makes the appropriate response more of a reaction, requiring less thinking during an actual emergency.</li></ul></li><li>Know the height of your street above sea level and the distance of your street from the coast or other high-risk waters.</li><li>If you are a tourist, familiarize yourself with local tsunami evacuation protocols. You may be able to safely evacuate to the third floor and higher in reinforced concrete hotel structures.</li></ul></p>
              <h2>During a Tsunami</h2>
        	  <p><ul><li>Follow the evacuation order issued by authorities and evacuate immediately. Take your animals with you.</li><li>Move inland to higher ground immediately. Pick areas 100 feet (30 meters) above sea level or go as far as 2 miles (3 kilometers) inland, away from the coastline. If you cannot get this high or far, go as high or far as you can. Every foot inland or upward may make a difference.</li><li>Stay away from the beach. Never go down to the beach to watch a tsunami come in. If you can see the wave you are too close to escape it. CAUTION - If there is noticeable recession in water away from the shoreline this is nature's tsunami warning and it should be heeded. You should move away immediately.</li><li>Save yourself - not your possessions.</li><li>Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance - infants, elderly people, and individuals with access or functional needs.</li></ul></p>
              <h2>After a Tsunami</h2>
        	  <p><ul><li>Return home only after local officials tell you it is safe. A tsunami is a series of waves that may continue for hours. Do not assume that after one wave the danger is over. The next wave may be larger than the first one.</li><li>Avoid disaster areas. Your presence might interfere with emergency response operations and put you at further risk from the residual effects of floods.</li><li>Stay away from debris in the water; it may pose a safety hazard to people or pets.</li><li>Check yourself for injuries and get first aid as needed before helping injured or trapped persons.</li><li>If someone needs to be rescued, call professionals with the right equipment to help. Many people have been killed or injured trying to rescue others.</li><li>Help people who require special assistance—infants, elderly people, those without transportation, people with access and functional needs and large families who may need additional help in an emergency situation.</li><li>Stay out of any building that has water around it. Tsunami water can cause floors to crack or walls to collapse.</li><li>Use caution when re-entering buildings or homes. Tsunami-driven floodwater may have damaged buildings where you least expect it. Carefully watch every step you take.</li><li>To avoid injury, wear protective clothing and be cautious when cleaning up.</li></ul></p>
