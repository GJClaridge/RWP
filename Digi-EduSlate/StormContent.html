        	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
        	  <p>All thunderstorms are dangerous. Every thunderstorm produces lightning. Most lightning victims survive, although people struck by lightning often report a variety of long-term, debilitating symptoms.</p>
			  <p>Other associated dangers of thunderstorms include tornadoes, strong winds, hail and flash flooding. Flash flooding is responsible for more fatalitiesthan any other thunderstorm-associated hazard.</p>
              <h2>Before a Storm</h2>
        	  <p><div class="accordion_fold" style="display: block;"><p>To prepare for a thunderstorm, you should do the following:</p><ul><li>Remove dead or rotting trees and branches that could fall and cause injury or damage during a severe thunderstorm.</li><li>Postpone outdoor activities.</li><li>Secure outdoor objects that could blow away or cause damage.</li><li>Get inside a home, building, or hard top automobile (not a convertible). Although you may be injured if lightning strikes your car, you are much safer inside a vehicle than outside.</li><li>Remember, rubber-soled shoes and rubber tires provide NO protection from lightning. However, the steel frame of a hard-topped vehicle provides increased protection if you are not touching metal.</li></ul><div><h3>Facts about Thunderstorms</h3><ul><li>They may occur singly, in clusters or in lines.</li><li>Some of the most severe occur when a single thunderstorm affects one location for an extended time.</li><li>Thunderstorms typically produce heavy rain for a brief period, anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.</li><li>Warm, humid conditions are highly favorable for thunderstorm development.</li></ul></div><div><h3>Facts about Lightning</h3><ul><li>Lightning’s unpredictability increases the risk to individuals and property.</li><li>Lightning often strikes outside of heavy rain and may occur as far as 10 miles away from any rainfall.</li><li>“Heat lightning” is actually lightning from a thunderstorm too far away from thunder to be heard. However, the storm may be moving in your direction.</li><li>Most lightning deaths and injuries occur when people are caught outdoors in the summer months during the afternoon and evening.</li><li>Your chances of being struck by lightning are estimated to be 1 in 600,000 but could be reduced even further by following safety precautions.</li><li>Lightning strike victims carry no electrical charge and should be attended to immediately.</li></ul></div></div></p>
              <h2>During a Storm</h2>
        	  <p><div class="accordion_fold" style="display: block;"><p>If thunderstorm and lightning are occurring in your area, you should:</p><ul><li>Avoid contact with electrical equipment or cords. Unplug appliances and other electrical items such as computers and turn off air conditioners. Power surges from lightning can cause serious damage.</li><li>Avoid contact with plumbing. Do not wash your hands, do not take a shower, do not wash dishes, and do not do laundry. Plumbing and bathroom fixtures can conduct electricity.</li><li>Stay away from windows and doors, and stay off porches.</li><li>Do not lie on concrete floors and do not lean against concrete walls.</li><li>Avoid natural lightning rods such as a tall, isolated tree in an open area.</li><li>Avoid hilltops, open fields, the beach or a boat on the water.</li><li>Take shelter in a sturdy building. Avoid isolated sheds or other small structures in open areas.</li><li>Avoid contact with anything metal—tractors, farm equipment, motorcycles, golf carts, golf clubs, and bicycles.</li></ul></div></p>
              <h2>After a Storm</h2>
        	  <p><div class="accordion_fold" style="display: block;"><p>The following are things you should check when you attempt to give aid to a victim of lightning:</p><ul><li><strong>Breathing</strong> - if breathing has stopped, begin mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.</li><li><strong>Heartbeat</strong> - if the heart has stopped, administer CPR.</li><li><strong>Pulse</strong> - if the victim has a pulse and is breathing, look for other possible injuries. Check for burns where the lightning entered and left the body. Also be alert for nervous system damage, broken bones and loss of hearing and eyesight.</li></ul><p>After the storm passes remember to:</p><ul><li>Never drive through a flooded roadway. Turn around, don’t drown!</li><li>Stay away from storm-damaged areas to keep from putting yourself at risk from the effects of severe thunderstorms.</li><li>Help people who may require special assistance, such as infants, children and the elderly or those with access or functional needs.</li><li>Stay away from downed power lines and report them immediately.</li><li>Watch your animals closely. Keep them under your direct control.</li></ul></div></p>
